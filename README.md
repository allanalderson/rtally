One of the annoying things with using a steadycam rig for live productions (apart from balance, camera roll and the rig’s weight) is the lack of a tally. 

I’ve designed a simple radio tally system that can communicate with up to 8 cameras wirelessly. It uses cheap transmitter/receiver combos available from eBay. They operate in the 600MHz band so check your local regulations. 
You’ll need one transmitter and a receiver for each camera. search for 'WT8' on ebay.
You might already be using these in your production as a wireless com system, so you’re in luck because the tally signal rides on the of the normal audio - on the same channel at the same time! A single UHF channel for audio and 8 camera tally signals. 

The project is called ‘rTally’ (short for Radio Tally). It is now open source on GitHub, so feel free to contribute at https://github.com/allanalderson/rtally
