One of the annoying things with using a steadycam rig for live productions (apart from getting a decent balance, camera roll and the rig’s weight) is the lack of a tally. So I’ve designed a simple radio tally system that can communicate with up to 8 cameras wirelessly. 
It uses a cheap transmitter/receiver combo available from eBay. They operate in the 600MHz range so check your local regulations. 
You’ll need one transmitter and a receiver for each camera. 

If you’re already using these in your production as a wireless com system, you’re in luck because the tally signal rides on the top of the normal audio - on the same channel at the same time! 
A single channel for audio and tally signals. 

The project is called ‘rTally’ (short for Radio Tally). It is now open source on GitHub , so feel free to make any changes to contribute.
